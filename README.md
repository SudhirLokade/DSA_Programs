# DSA_Programs on Recursion
This programs are used to show the all recursion methods

# Recursion
 To check simple recursion click on this: [Simple Recursion](https://github.com/SudhirLokade/DSA_Programs/blob/main/Recursion.java)
 - Simple recursion is performed
 - Printed a name/number for n number of times

# Recursion Backtracking
To check backtracking recursion click on this: [Backtracking recursion](https://github.com/SudhirLokade/DSA_Programs/blob/main/Recursion_Backtracking.java)
- Printing numbers from n to 1 using backtracking
- It approches the given task in the some different way like by changing base conditions
  # Backtracking
  - Choice: Make a decision to try a particular option.
  - Explore: Explore all possibilities associated with that decision.
  - Constraint: Check if the current combination of choices satisfies the problem constraints.
  - Backtrack: If the current combination does not satisfy the constraints, undo the last decision and try a different one.
# Multiple Recursion 
- Multiple recursion refers to a situation in which a function calls itself more than once during its execution. 
- The function exhibits recursive behavior, and at each recursive step, it makes multiple calls to itself.
- The best example of multiple recursion is fibonacci series
- Here is sample code for fibonacci function
  ```java
        public static int fibonacci(int n) {
        if (n == 0) {
            return 0;
        } else if (n == 1) {
            return 1;
        } else {
            return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2);
        }
    }
  ```

# Reverse Array 
- It reverse the given array
- To check the reverse array click on this: [Reverse array](https://github.com/SudhirLokade/DSA_Programs/blob/main/Reverse_Array.java)
